The Plain project is a Rails engine that serves as an Artificial Intelligence (AI) assistant for your Rails project. It's designed to provide deeper, more meaningful context to your work in real-time. It's not just about organizing your codes or managing your project structure, but also about analyzing your project on the go. Using AI, it can instantly provide explanations and insights about various aspects of your Rails project, effectively becoming an intelligent companion during your development process.

In addition to being an AI assistant, Plain also acts as a comprehensive documentation site. It has the ability to take markdown files and seamlessly integrate them into the documentation site. This allows developers to add, modify, or access documentation effortlessly and intuitively. 

The Plain project was proudly developed and presented during the esteemed Rails Hackathon 2023.
